Samples are drawn from this cdf-scale and converted back to quantiles at the parameter scale.\n\nSobol indices are estimated using the method of Touati (2016), which has a total cost of (p+2)n, where p is the number of parameters and n is the number of samples in each of the two random parameter samples.\n\nArguments\n\nf: a function to compute a set of results, whose sensitivity is to be inspected, from parametes (p1, p2, ...) -> NamedTuple{NTuple{N,NT}} where NT <: Number,  for example fsens = (a,b) -> (;target1 = a + b -1, target2 = a + b -0.5).\nparmsModeUpperRows: a Vector of Tuples of the form  (:par_name, Distribution, mode, 95%_quantile) where Distribution is a non-parameterized Object from Distributions.jl such as LogNormal.
